Changes with idn_one_nine (2013-08-15)

* This is purely a test to see if I can get native IDN support. Use of this gem
  is not recommended at this time.

Changes with IDN 0.0.2 (2006-02-11)

* Remove excessive xfree() if a call to stringprep_profile() returns an

  existing test methods.

* Improve existing tests for IDN::Idna.

Changes with IDN 0.0.1 (2005-09-26)
